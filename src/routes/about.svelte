	<p class="max-w-prose">
		The Random Song Game was created by Jake Blank and Andrew Schnitkey in 2021. The idea is to each
		randomly select a song from our archives of old mp3s, then listen to each song and discuss. This
		app was developed by Andrew Schnitkey for two purposes. One, to practice developing an app using
		SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS. And Two, to make it easier to randomly select a song every day.
